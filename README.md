# BinaryTreeTraversals

Unlike linear data structures (Array, Linked List, Queues, Stacks, etc) which have only one logical way to traverse them, trees can be traversed in different ways.
In this particular project I used.... 1)inOrder
                                      2)preOrder
                                      3)postOrder
                                      4)levelOrder
                                     
To run the code download and open the classes in Eclipse (Eclipse Oxygen).
run configurations - Main class       : Traversal.java
